MRI location-allocation

Suplementar material for manuscript entitled "Re-designing the accessibility of MRI medical services: a case study of Brazilian National Health System", for Decision Analytics Journal. Reference: DAJOUR-D-22-00090.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are sophisticated and costly equipment that provides the required means for accurate diagnosis. The dissemination of its use at medium and high complexity healthcare facilities increase the cost of health care systems and impose re-design challenges for accessibility, an issue of global importance for equity-based health care systems. However, few studies approach this problem from multiple location-allocation perspectives.

Brazil has MRI service in 462 municipalities, while 5,107 municipalities do not have an MRI, consequently, patients need to travel hundreds of kilometers to access the service.

We approach the health care planning issue of patients' accessibility to MRI equipment based on mathematical models to the case of Brazilian National Health System. We evaluate the problem on the municipality level and recommend different alternatives of location and the acquisition of new devices to uncovered areas throughout the country.

For the 210 MRIs' scenario, the best decision is to assign 108 new MRIs to sites that already have an infrastructure and select 102 new locations to receive MRIs

The study demonstrates that while some municipalities have an over supply, several regions in the country are uncovered of MRI medical service. The models are based on equity principles to propose the number of new MRI and their locations for uncovered municipalities. 

Results suggest, for instance, that the acquisition of 210 MRIs is enough to satisfy 95\% of the demand for such service, with patients traveling 118 km and 44 km on average in the north and complementary regions of country, respectively.

The purchase of 109 new MRIs added to the 2,349 existing MRI devices would be capable of performing 3.86 million MRI exams per year, covering the demand for 4,926 municipalities, 88\% of the total. The acquisition of 210 new MRIs would be sufficient to perform 4.15 million MRIs per year, covering the demand for 5,289 municipalities, 95\% of the total. The acquisition of 312 new MRIs would be sufficient to perform 4.29 million MRI exams per year, covering the demand for 5,316 municipalities, 95\% of the total.

We report accessibility gains by location-allocation plans that consider different MRIs offer profiles to evaluate patient displacement.
